# GetYouTubeAudioFile  
"Get Youtube Audio File" is a Python script to download music files from YouTube using youtube-dl.  
  
It is set to download the maximum quality audio file available (usually webm or m4a), but you can choose to convert the file to some other format (i.e. mp4/m4a, mp3).

I have included an handy [Siri Shortcut](https://github.com/Emasoft/GetYouTubeAudioFile/tree/main/siri%20shortcut) to use the script even on iOS/iPad OS.
